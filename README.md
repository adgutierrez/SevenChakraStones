# SevenChakraStones (The Best I Could In 10 Days)
Game is no way near completion
Seven Chakra Stones was created for the GameDev.tv 2022 Game Jam
Trying to learn C# programming through the GameDev.tv course
First time doing a jam, first time putting the courses I have done together
Still have a long way to. Hoping it’s enough to be eligible for the free course
Game is no way near completion. After starting the project three times
I went with the bare minimum just to get something to up load. Even then it's kind of working
Unable to get the “Intro” scene to work or the “Finish” scene torestart
Game:  Collect all seven chakra stones and stop the cycle of “Death and Rebirth”
Search for the Chakra Stone and move to the next level.
